understand the router specification

use the structure, dynamic arrays and queues

inplement user defined data type to create packet

implement tasks/functions with sytructure as argument

use ref direction with methods

generate and drive stimulus into dut

verify dut behaviour with waveform


basic router verification environment using system verilog

a specific packet is send to the router design and we check the waveform whether the DUT is sending the packet on the output port pin
